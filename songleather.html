                    <b>Summary: </b> Song Leather is a small business venture I started at the end of 2020. As quarantine began, I brainstormed viable projects that would allow me to gain experience in designing. I first started with wooden branches that blew down in a storm in my backyard, turning them into various utensils like spoons, butter knives, and forks. As I progressed, I began looking into better tools and discovered a large gap in the market for simple, sustainable tool covers that were largely universal. As I delved into leatherworking, I began crafting personal items like wallets and belts. During my journey, I was fortunate to make a viral video courtesy of my sister, which provided me with an abundance of orders. Since each wallet and bag took me a few days, and even weeks to make, I began to scale down a little. More recently, I've exclusively made gifts for friends and family.
                    <br><br><b>Problem Statement:  </b> Create real-world impact and gain experience with marketing and product design through opening a small business.

                            <b>Design Process: </b> Based on my research, I realized I needed an element of uniqueness to convey the handmade aspect of my wallets, so I strayed away from the traditional bifold wallets. A few aspects I kept in mind were manufacturing efficiency, structural integrity, card accessibility, and overall ergonomics. Once I came up with a general design, I implemented an iterative prototyping process using paper models. Next, each pattern was converted digitally to later be printed out for consistency. Finally, I spent the next few months personally carrying the wallet, tweaking the design as necessary, before releasing it on my website.

                            <b>Future Considerations: </b> Take into consideration scalability and manufacturability before establishing brand values. This was apparent during the first early wave of orders, which later led me to limit availability, resulting in fewer sales. Choose a less controversial material than leather. Many misconceptions about leather, although related to illegal poaching of exotic animals, affected the entire public view on leather goods.
                            <br><br><b>Conclusion: </b> I was able to accomplish my early goals of gaining experience with product design and marketing, and share my message on sustainability.
